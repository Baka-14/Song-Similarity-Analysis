# Data

Place your feature dataset here.

- **`ALL_Features.xlsx`** — Excel file with extracted audio features (e.g. from jAudio).
  - Expected: ~254 rows (songs), one `Genre` column (1–5), and ~2255 feature columns.
  - Genres: 1 = Hip-Hop, 2 = Pop, 3 = Rock, 4 = Carnatic, 5 = Jazz.

If you run the notebook from the project root, use path `data/ALL_Features.xlsx` in the notebook, or place the file in the project root.
